        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Not visible.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>Elements: Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
      <li>The "ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. </li>
      <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The "img" element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
      <li>"br":element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
      <li> hyperlink: The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
      <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
      <li> `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. Useful for SEO</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Now that the CSS rule has been assigned to the class selector, .card, let's review the HTML to ensure that the selector has been assigned to the correct elements. Notice that the section elements already contain the following class attribute:
          `section class="card"` 
          <br>
            As shown in the preceding element, a class selector, .class, has been assigned to all four `section` elements in the markup. Therefore, all four `section` elements on this page will contain the same property assignments according to the CSS rule.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout main: to go to main branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull down the latest main branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>You should see the following message in your terminal: "Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-html'"</li>
            <li>Now you are in a the new branch</li>
          <li>git status: to confirm which branch your are on</li>
          <li>go to VS</li>

        <h3>Git Flow </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> git add -A: to commit all files in the working branch. </li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit them to our repository. Use the command in your terminal to commit the changes. We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
          <li>git pull origin main:It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.

            You should see something similar to the following in your terminal if your branches are in sync:
            
            Already up to date. </li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html: push branch</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>se escribe una VARiable luego el nombre de la variable seguido del = y despues lo que contiene la variable. Puede ser un solo elemento o un grupo.</li>
          <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Para hacer un array se ponen los elementos del grupo dentro de [ , , ] </li>
          <li>Notice that only the student's name, "Lu", is surrounded by quotation marks. That is because Lu is a string, and strings need to be contained within quotation marks. Since 54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotation marks are necessary for those values. </li>
          <li>Loops: A `for` loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>In order to use the `for` loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. </li>
          <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named `length`.</li>
          <li>3 statements for `for`loop: </li>
            <ol>
              <li>x = 0; porque es el inicio</li>
              <li>x < shapes.length; porque debe llegar hasta el final</li>
              <li>x++ ; The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1. Para que corra cada uno de los elementos en orden.</li>
              <li>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                <br> // code block
               <br> }
              <br>así se tiene que ver, en este caso vamos a poner que enliste las variables en la consola usando:
            <br>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
             <br> console.log(shapes[x]);
            <br> }
          </li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Define and Call a Function</li>
          <li>After `function`name the funtion and then open parenthesis then open brackets. Write the instruction inside the brackets</li>
          <li>then you can call the function in order to work. Try this in the console/li>
