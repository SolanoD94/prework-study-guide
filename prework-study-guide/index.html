          <li> git add -A: to commit all files in the working branch. </li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit them to our repository. Use the command in your terminal to commit the changes. We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
          <li>git pull origin main:It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.

            You should see something similar to the following in your terminal if your branches are in sync:
            
            Already up to date. </li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html: push branch</li>
